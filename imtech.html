                <p>The iM.Tech course curriculum consists of Core Courses and Electives spanning ten semesters. <br>
                            While the same set of core courses have to be completed by all the students every semester, the students are free to choose their electives. While core courses help in creating a strong foundation in the Information Technology field, electives allow students to learn and specialize in their own areas of interest.

Electives are also categorized into Computer Science, Electronics & Communication, Data Science, Networks & Communication along with other core courses, are taken up from sixth semester till the ninth semester

The current(ninth) semester requires students to take any two electives and a twelve credit Project under the supervision of a Professor in the college. During the tenth semester, a student can either take up an industry internship or academic research at the institute leading to a thesis.

                            <h2 style="color:#6a23b5;font-size:28px;">Interned in the Computational Sciences Laboratory- IIIT Bangalore under Professor Dr. G.N.S. Prasanna</h2><br><br>
                            <p>We have developed algorithms to handle financial computations in binary machines at high speeds. Our algorithms are significantly faster than Java bigDecimal() and decNumber() libraries, and are within an order of magnitude of the raw hardware speed not counting format conversions. Additionally, we have also developed faster format conversion algorithms to convert decimal to string, using precomputed table - lookup. These algorithms are faster than atof and atoi. Financial calculations for transactions involving up to Rs. 100 million can be performed efficiently using this algorithm. Interest calculations and currency conversions are also significantly speeded up. These algorithms are implemented in software and can be extended to hardware.

                            <p>Warehouse Management is one of the key checkpoints in the supply chain. It is necessary to optimise the process of fulfilling a given order request for both the consumer (order fulfilment in minimum time) and the warehouse (order delivery in minimum cost). The project involves exploration of reinforcement techniques to automate and optimise these processes.</p>

                            <p>Our understanding of web has been evolving from that of a passive repository to a participatory socio-cognitive space, where human beings are participants rather than users of it. To be able to perceive how the society is transforming, it is very important to understand how the web is impacting the social cognition. The socio-cognitive space is providing a common global platform where each individual can express his/her viewpoints and can be heard by others. The socio-cognitive space is acting as a Marketplace of Opinions, where ‘opinion’ is the currency and all the participants invest their opinions on the marketplace to get certain returns. We are trying to understand how this opinion marketplace is shaping or transforming the social cognition of the society in various ways. As a part of this bigger domain of interest, one of the specific problem we are addressing is to identify the opinion `drivers’ on the social media, who have an intention to steer the topic of discussion to a particular direction. In addition to identifying the drivers, we are also trying to identify different narratives of a topic.</p>

                            <h2 style="color:#6a23b5;font-size:28px;">In collaboration with RIKEN Brain Science Institute (now RIKEN CBS)</h2><br><br>
                            <p>Working Integrated Theoretical Neuroscience to understand and implement a computational model for 'Theory of Mind' . Theory of Mind is a key concept of psychology that forms the basis of social interaction. I also had the chance to listen to several prolific speakers in the intersection of Neuroscience and AI including the likes of Prof. Yoshua Bengio and Prof. Terrence Sejnowski. 8. Title: Effect of scene content in image quality assessment Description: This research aims at automating image quality assessment (i.e. to make a model that would predict quality scores for an image closer to the ones perceived by humans). The quality scores predicted by existing algorithms is far from the actual ones observed by humans for authentically(naturally) distorted images. I worked on checking whether the scene content of an image has an influence on the quality perceived by humans. This insight would be useful in improving the performance of existing algorithms.
